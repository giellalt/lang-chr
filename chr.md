## Analysis symbols
The morphological analyses of wordforms of Cherokee are presented
in this system in terms of following symbols.

(It is highly suggested to follow existing standards when adding new tags).

The parts-of-speech could perhaps also be (remove irrelevant):

 * +Pr	     =
 * +Interj  =
 * +Pcle    =
 * +Num     =

 * +Def   =
 * +Indef  =

The parts of speech are further split up into:

 * +Prop    =
 * +Pers    =
 * +Dem     =
 * +Interr  =
 * +Refl    =
 * +Recipr  =
 * +Rel     =
 * +Indef   =

The Usage extents are marked using the following tags:
 *  +Err/Orth      = Substandard forms
 *  +Use/-Spell   = Not included in speller

The nominals are inflected in the following Number

 * +Sg    =
 * +Pl    =

The verbs can have the following morphological features:






 * +Fut    =
