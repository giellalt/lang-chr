Multichar_Symbols  !!≈ !!!@CODE@ definitions

!! !!Analysis symbols
!! ----------------
!! The morphological analyses of wordforms of Northern Haida are presented
!! in this system in terms of following symbols.

!! (It is highly suggested to follow existing standards when adding new tags).

!! The parts-of-speech could perhaps also be (remove irrelevant):

+N	    !!= * @CODE@ =
+A	    !!= * @CODE@ =
+Adv    !!= * @CODE@ =
+Pron   !!= * @CODE@ =
+CS	    !!= * @CODE@ =
+CC	    !!= * @CODE@ =
+Adp    !!= * @CODE@ =
+Po	    !!= * @CODE@ =
+Pr	    !!= * @CODE@ =
+Interj !!= * @CODE@ =
+Pcle   !!= * @CODE@ =
+Num    !!= * @CODE@ =

+Def  !!= * @CODE@ =
+Indef !!= * @CODE@ =

!! The parts of speech are further split up into:

+Prop   !!= * @CODE@ =
+Pers   !!= * @CODE@ =
+Dem    !!= * @CODE@ =
+Interr !!= * @CODE@ =
+Refl   !!= * @CODE@ =
+Recipr !!= * @CODE@ =
+Rel    !!= * @CODE@ =
+Indef  !!= * @CODE@ =

!! The Usage extents are marked using the following tags:
 +Err/Sub     !!= * @CODE@ = Substandard forms
 +Use/-Spell  !!= * @CODE@ = Not included in speller

!! The nominals are inflected in the following Number

+Sg   !!= * @CODE@ =
+Pl   !!= * @CODE@ =

%^WS	!!=* @CODE@ = whitespace dummy, for twolc

! Abbreviated words are classified with:

+ABBR !!= * @CODE@ = Abbreviations
+ACR  !!= * @CODE@ = Acronyms

 
!! Special symbols are classified with:
+CLB   !!= * @CODE@ = Clause boundary symbols
+PUNCT !!= * @CODE@ = Other punctuation marks
+LEFT  !!= * @CODE@ = Left part of paired symbols
+RIGHT !!= * @CODE@ = Right part of paired symbols

!! The verbs are syntactically split according to transitivity:
+TV !!= * @CODE@ 
+IV !!= * @CODE@ 

!! Special multiword units are analysed with:
 +Multi !!= * @CODE@ 

!! Non-dictionary words can be recognised with:
 +Guess !!= * @CODE@

!   Adjectives  ;
!   Pronouns    ;
